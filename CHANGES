v0.12.1
[A] queue_type be public enum
[B] fix ctimespec operator

v0.12.0
[+] crofsock: revised tx-queueing strategy (default txqueue size limited 
    to 128 messages), API changes to crofctl and crofdpt: all transmission
    methods return the queueing result when sending an openflow message:
    MSG_QUEUED, MSG_QUEUED_CONGESTION, MSG_QUEUEING_FAILED_*
[B] crofchantest: thread sanitizer friendly
[B] build-system: update OpenSSL dependency
[A] typos in functions fixed

[B] crofconn: call handle_closed in case echo_request_expired
[+] use of __FUNCTION__ instead of __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ is sufficient
[O] Documentation updated wrt. dependencies
[B] crofbase: prevent shadowing of cthread callbacks

v0.11.0
[B] made ofp_version atomic
[B] multiple thread related issues found with tsan
[B] crofsock: txqueue order of barrier requests
[+] crofbase: allow set_ctl without creation of a new instance
[B] ctimespec: invalid calculation and data race fixed
[+] travis: print log of failed tests
[+] log exceptions caught in thread

v0.10.9

[+] fixed issues with compilation under GCC6
[+] Extended behaviour of method rofl::crofbase::set_dpt()

v0.10.8

[B] crofdpt: do not automatically assign xid to experimenter
    messages

v0.10.7

[B] crofsock: fixed bug in congestion management
[+] cthread: allow level-triggered file descriptors

v0.10.6

[B] crofsock: prevent infinite loop
    In case txqueues are not empty tx is rescheduled. The 
    flag to do so was not cleared and this would cause an 
    infinite loop. Reset the flag to prevent this.
[B] crofsock: crofsock: set tx_fragment_pending in tx saturation
    A packet in the txbuffer would not be sent in case tx 
    was saturated tx_fragment_pending is set to resend the 
    packet, that was already cleared from the txqueues.
[B] crofsock: txqueue_size_tx_threshold checking fixed
    If txqueue_pending_pkts == 1, the calculation of
    txqueue_size_tx_threshold might lead to a never cleared
    FLAG_TX_BLOCK_QUEUEING flag.
[B] cthread: don't throw in destructor 
[B] crofchantest: fix increments done in threads
    num_of_ctl_established and num_of_accepts are incremented 
    from diffrent threads, hence the test randomly fails or 
    succeeds.
[B] crofsocktest: fix timeout
    timeout was already -1 in CPPUNIT_ASSERT
[K] TLS support broken
    crofsocktest: disabling TLS test
[B] cthread: fix edge-triggered behaviour of epoll
    pipe still uses level-triggered scheme
[B] crofsock: don't let handle_write_event run at state STATE_CLOSED 
[B] crofsock: do not wakeup tx in case its blocked
[B] crofconn: fixed potential race condition during connection 
    establishment (HELLO negotiation)
[B] crofsock: add rxthread wakeup handler
    call recv_message() after connect/EINPROGRESS continuation
    in state STATE_TCP_CONNECTING
[B] crofsock: fixed bug in listening mode

v0.10.5

[B] version is broken, do not use

v0.10.4

[B] crofchan: fixed a bug introduced in v0.10.3 while fixing
    the other bug: actively established connections must not be
    removed upon handle_closed()
[B] cthread: check timer for expiration again before calling 
    handle_timeout()
[B] crofsock: allow transmission of Echo-Request/Reply messages
    even when flow-control is blocking transmission of other 
    messages received from the application layer

v0.10.3

[O] added cclockid class to prevent invalid use of class ctimespec
[+] crofsock: use SO_LINGER option for coordinated shutdown
[+] crofsock: make backlog for listening mode configurable, defaults to 
    64 established TCP connections
[B] crofconn: fixed potential race condition causing a Hello expiration
[A] crofchan: send CLOSE notification to application when replacing
    an existing connection object (restart)
[B] crofchan: fixed bug in handle_closed(): conn was not removed from
    crofchan::conns map leading to a double free
